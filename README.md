# simpleLineFitter

This code takes a comma-separated list of coordinates supplied by the user (via stdin) and outputs a line of best-fit, found by linear regression.  The parameters of the fit and the Pearson correlation coefficient are printed to the terminal while the data and best-fit line are plotted on a graph.
